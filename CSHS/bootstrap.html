         <h3>History</h3>
         <p>Coral Springs High School (CSHS) first opened its doors in 1975 with Paul Proffitt as Principal. Proffitt participated in the original planning of the high school and hand-picked the administration and teachers who would guide the school through the
           1980s. During that time, Coral Springs outgrew to its nickname of "The City in the Country", eventually becoming one of the most populous cities in Florida. Coral Springs High School was the city's first high school. The school originally opened
           as a collection of portable classrooms at what is now the site of Coral Springs Medical Center, with a student population of some 1,200 students. In 1976, the main building opened at its current location. By the 1980-1981 school year, CSHS was organized
           into double sessions to accommodate 3,764 students. By the fall of 1981, a second high school - J. P. Taravella High School - was opened, thereby reducing the student population down to 2,400 students.
